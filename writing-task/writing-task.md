### Sample essay

The "nature versus nurture" debate has continued for many years.  Some people claim we have our personality from birth and it does not change. However, I would suggest that personality is not fixed.  It changes over time.

Studies on a variety of participants have confirmed that several variables can change personalities.  It is certainly true too that when people meet again at reunions, they often notice that friends or co-workers have changed as they have matured. This may be because they are influenced by other people or their own circumstances and experiences throughout their lives.  These can make them more or less confident or modest, for example.

There is also evidence that people can train themselves to be different.  For this reason, companies often invest in training programs to make employees more extroverted, more thinking or more feeling towards others, for instance.

Other factors can also affect personality in temporary and permanent ways.  For example, experiencing trauma means people tend to become more nervous, or more introverted. However, counseling and medical treatment can help reverse this， so the effect on personality is often only temporary. Other medical conditions，such as Alzheimer's Disease, may have detrimental and more permanent consequences for the personalities of the sufferer and others.

In conclusion, personality is connected to our genes, but it does not define us.  Environmental factors mean that as humans we can and do change throughout our lives.  Because we have scope for change, we are also able to train ourselves and improve when this is desirable.

### 范文

“先天与后天”的争论已经持续了很多年。有些人声称我们的个性从出生就有，而且不会改变。然而，我认为人格并不是一成不变的。它会随时间变化。

对不同参与者的研究已经证实，有几个变量可以改变性格。当然，当人们在聚会上再次见面时，他们通常会注意到朋友或同事随着他们的成熟而发生了变化。这可能是因为他们一生中受到他人或自身环境和经历的影响。例如，这会让他们变得或多或少自信或谦虚。

也有证据表明，人们可以训练自己变得与众不同。出于这个原因，公司经常投资培训项目，让员工更外向，对他人有更多的思考或感受。

其他因素也会以暂时和永久的方式影响人格。例如，经历创伤意味着人们倾向于变得更紧张，或更内向。然而，咨询和医疗可以帮助扭转这种情况，所以对人格的影响往往只是暂时的。其他疾病，如阿尔茨海默氏症，可能会对患者及其他人的性格造成有害和更持久的后果。

总之，性格与我们的基因有关，但它不能定义我们。环境因素意味着作为人类，我们可以也确实在我们的一生中改变。因为我们有改变的余地，我们也能够在需要的时候自我训练和提高。

### Sample essay

In many countries，supermarkets selling mass-produced goods are dominating the economy. Artisans are being replaced by factories，with machines and robots mass-producing goods.  However, there are several advantages handmade products, both for the consumer and the people who make and sell them.
One major benefit of handmade pieces is that they are unique. Factory-made products can be generic. Two bowls from a superstore may be functional, and of good quality, but will be identical. Two bowls made by the same artisan can be entirely different depending on their mood,environment, and materials. Many people value these unique features, and will pay extra for them. Not only does the customer enjoy handmade goods, the crafts people can benefit too. Handcrafts provide jobs for the artisans. Factories creating mass-produced products can often harm the community by replacing people with machines, taking away these jobs.
Finally, entire communities and societies can benefit from handmade goods. Buying these products can enhance local economy. The profits from the sale of handmade goods can often stay in the local area, rather than going large manufacturing company, which may be in a different location, or even overseas. Such handcrafts are also of local or even national culture and buying them can help the unique skills and traditions to survive.
In conclusion，machine-made products can certainly have advantages. However，in my view， there are more advantages of handmade products, especially for local artisans and communities. It is important that we value and preserve this important aspect of culture.

### 范文

在许多国家，出售大批量生产商品的超市主导着经济。工匠正在被工厂所取代，机器和机器人在大量生产商品。然而，手工产品对消费者和制作和销售它们的人都有一些优势。
手工制品的一个主要好处是它们是独一无二的。工厂生产的产品可能是通用的。从超市买的两个碗可能是功能性的，质量也不错，但会是一样的。同一个工匠做的两只碗，根据他们的心情、环境和材料的不同，可能会完全不同。许多人重视这些独特的功能，并愿意为此支付额外的费用。不仅顾客喜欢手工制品，手工艺人也能从中受益。手工艺品为工匠提供了工作。制造大规模生产产品的工厂用机器取代人，抢走了这些工作，常常会伤害到社区。
最后，整个社区和社会都可以从手工制品中受益。购买这些产品可以促进当地经济的发展。手工制品的销售利润通常会留在当地，而不是流向大型制造公司，后者可能在不同的地点，甚至是海外。这些手工艺品也具有地方甚至民族文化，购买它们可以帮助独特的技能和传统生存下来。
总之，机器制造的产品肯定有优点。然而，在我看来，手工产品有更多的优势，特别是对当地的工匠和社区。我们重视并保护文化的这一重要方面是很重要的。



## Unit 3 Writing task

How important is it for countries to fund research into disease?

各国资助疾病研究有多重要？

### Sample essay

Disease is one of the major reasons for deaths and economic losses worldwide. All national governments have to try to tackle this issue. One of the main ways most governments can do this is by funding research.
Funding research can help both prevent and treat disease. Through research, people can find out the reasons for the transmission of disease and therefore help prevent it. When researchers found proof that polluted water supplies resulted in cholera,for instance, effective water treatment systems were introduced, and the number of infected people fell dramatically. Similarly, researchers have developed vaccines against diseases such as polio, which used to be widespread but has been virtually eradicated in some countries. Unless such research continues, diseases such as HlV and cancer may never be prevented. Equally,research can help develop treatments for those who have already contracted these diseases, preventing suffering and even death.
There are many risks of not funding research. Lives may be lost because of disease, and the economy may also suffer as a result of the sick leave people take, and the cost to the health care system. Ultimately, it is a moral duty of governments to protect citizens, and to prevent the costs that disease brings. Provided they can afford it, it is essential that all governments fund research into disease. However, such research is expensive, and not all the countries are able to afford to fund it themselves. Consequently, the wealthier nations have the responsibility to fund research and share the benefits with countries which cannot afford it.

### 范文

疾病是全世界造成死亡和经济损失的主要原因之一。所有国家的政府都必须努力解决这个问题。大多数政府能够做到这一点的主要方法之一是资助研究。
资助研究可以帮助预防和治疗疾病。通过研究，人们可以找到疾病传播的原因，从而帮助预防它。例如，当研究人员发现水污染供水导致霍乱的证据时，就引入了有效的水处理系统，感染人数大幅下降。类似地，研究人员已经开发出针对脊髓灰质炎等疾病的疫苗，这种疾病曾经很普遍，但在一些国家已几乎被根除。除非继续进行这样的研究，否则艾滋病毒和癌症等疾病可能永远无法预防。同样，研究可以帮助那些已经感染了这些疾病的人开发治疗方法，防止痛苦，甚至死亡。
不资助研究有很多风险。疾病可能会夺去生命，人们请病假以及医疗保健系统的费用也可能会影响经济。归根结底，保护公民和防止疾病带来的代价是政府的道德责任。只要各国政府能够负担得起，就有必要为疾病研究提供资金。然而，这样的研究是昂贵的，并不是所有的国家都有能力自己资助它。因此，较富裕的国家有责任资助研究，并与负担不起的国家分享成果。



## Unit 4 Writing task

This graph compares trends in animal populations. Write a summary describing the trends and give reasons for the changes.

这张图表比较了动物数量的趋势。写一篇总结，描述趋势并给出变化的原因。

<img src="img/image-20221129102907370.png" alt="image-20221129102907370" style="zoom:67%;" />



### Sample essay

The chart shows a comparison of numbers of four animals in one region of Africa from 1960 to 2020.
The number of some animals has been falling. There were 12,000 wild dogs in 1960, but there are 25% fewer in 2020. There were 20,000 lions initially, but there is currently only one tenth that number. These substantial declines may have been due to hunting, either to control pests or for trophies. Another threat could have been urbanization and loss of habitats.
However, this drop in numbers is not inevitable, and not all the species have shown a declining trend in numbers. The number of zebras has remained at 15,000 though with slight fluctuation during the 60 years, and growing numbers of rhinos suggest they have been thriving. There were only 2,000 at first, but there are six times as many now. This might be attributed to official protection of both species and their habitats in order to preserve diversity.

* Note that the present time in the summary refers to 2020 when it was written.

### 范文

该图表显示了非洲一个地区从1960年到2020年四种动物数量的比较。
一些动物的数量一直在下降。1960年有12000只野狗，但到2020年减少了25%。最初有两万头狮子，但现在只有十分之一。数量的大幅下降可能是由于为了控制害虫或为了获得战利品而进行的狩猎活动。另一个威胁可能是城市化和栖息地的丧失。
然而，数量的下降并不是不可避免的，并不是所有的物种都呈现出数量下降的趋势。斑马的数量一直保持在1.5万头，不过在这60年里有轻微的波动，而犀牛数量的增长表明它们一直很繁荣。起初只有2000个，但现在已经是原来的六倍。这可能是因为官方为了保持物种多样性而对这两个物种及其栖息地进行了保护。

*请注意，摘要中的当前时间指的是它撰写时的2020年。



## Unit 5 Writing task

Should employees speak out if their colleagues are unethical?

如果同事不道德，员工应该说出来吗?

### Sample essay

Should employees speak out if their colleagues are unethical?
Most employees have been witnesses to unethical conduct at some point, but speaking out against colleagues takes considerable courage. This essay will argue that although it is hard, employees must speak up when they see illegal or unethical conduct, to ensure safety, and financial and political security.
It could be argued that coworkers should be loyal to each other. When they see unethical conduct, it is not their responsibility to act. Their employer or the justice system should deal with the issue.
However, it is often essential that employees themselves report the activity which goes against a company, institute,organization, or government's code of ethics. In some cases,this ensures safety. Many more air accidents would have occurred if the aviation industry had not introduced regulations requiring pilots to speak up when they had concerns about their coworkers, for instance.
In other cases, employees should speak up to protect economic interests. It can be argued that some financial crises could have been prevented if people working in the sector had spoken out. Investigations would have happened sooner, and people's jobs and savings would have been protected.
People in positions of political power should also report colleagues who abuse their positions. This would mean investigation and punishment of those who act unethically. It would prevent controversies and scandals，and maintain a stable and legitimate government.
In conclusion, all employees have a duty to speak out when they see unethical conduct, but this can be very hard Employers should create a culture of transparency, where ethical behavior and honesty are rewarded.

### 范文

如果同事不道德，员工应该说出来吗?
大多数员工都曾目睹过不道德的行为，但公开反对同事需要相当大的勇气。这篇文章将论证，尽管很难，但员工必须在看到非法或不道德的行为时说出来，以确保安全、财务和政治安全。
可以说，同事之间应该互相忠诚。当他们看到不道德的行为时，他们没有责任采取行动。他们的雇主或司法系统应该处理这个问题。
然而，雇员自己报告违反公司、机构、组织或政府道德准则的行为通常是很重要的。在某些情况下，这确保了安全。例如，如果航空业没有出台规定，要求飞行员在对同事的担忧时直言不讳，那么就会发生更多的航空事故。
在其他情况下，员工应该站出来保护经济利益。可以说，如果该行业的从业人员公开发声，一些金融危机本可以避免。调查就会更早展开，人们的工作和储蓄就会得到保护。
有政治权力的人也应该举报滥用职权的同事。这意味着对那些不道德行为的人进行调查和惩罚。它将防止争议和丑闻，维持一个稳定和合法的政府。
总之，所有的员工都有义务在他们看到不道德的行为时说出来，但这可能是非常困难的。雇主应该创造一种透明的文化，在那里道德行为和诚实会得到奖励。
